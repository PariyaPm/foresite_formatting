# Python Coding Style

Make sure that you use [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
coding style for your python codes. in different IDEs the coding style can be 
configured in the editor tool of project configurations. 
For example in pycharm you can follow the instructions of reformatting to
pep 8 following this [link](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/reformat-and-rearrange-code.html)

Use numpy [docstring](./https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) for your documentation, summaries and descriptions on the file. You can set the docstring in your IDE, pycharm setup is provided [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-docstrings-to-specify-types.html). 

The code sample provided [here](https://github.com/PariyaPm/foresite_formatting/blob/master/code_samples/python_sample.py).

File names should follow the [naming convention](./naming_convention.md)
and spatial data requires to be in the [geo-spatial_formatting](./geo_data_formatting.md).
